            The Jpura Tamil Union is dedicated to improving the educational standards of students from underprivileged areas. 
            Our G.C.E A/L exam initiative aims to support students in five key subjects: Tamil, English, History, Mathematics, and Science. 
            This program provides an opportunity for students to excel academically, helping them overcome barriers and achieve their dreams.

            Through this initiative, we aim to uplift communities, bridge the educational gap, and ensure that every student has access to quality education, regardless of their background.
